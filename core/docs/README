Description:
My Handy Restaurant is a software created to help restaurant waiters and managers in their job.

Waiters can choose a restaurant table, assign orders to it and have them automatically printed on printers.
"Normal" dishes could also be modificied, by adding or removing ingredients.
Bills can be printed automatically, even for separated bills.
The accounting section allows a restaurant manager to easily administrate the whole accounting (bank accounts, employees, suppliers, income) in an easy way.
Stock managing is also available, and items quantity is automatically updated.

The main key points of the system are the hardware independency, because of the HTTP client-server use, that could be found on most of the off-the-shelf handhelds solutions, and the strong integration between waiter/manager/stocking sections.

My Handy restaurant is written in PHP server language and uses MySQL as working database.

The interface is handheld sized and is written to be compatible with most of the handheld browsers, so to be totally platform independent.
This allows a reduction of about 50% of the implementation costs, compared to usual restaurant handheld solutions.

The project is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public license (see LICENSE file).
